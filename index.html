    <h1>Breanna Tafe</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Breanna, and I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in gaming, programming, and animation. I enjoy learning new technologies and building projects that help me improve my skills. In my free time, I like to cook and think up game design, and I am excited to explore more opportunities in game programming. This page is part of my first web development assignment, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer.</p>
